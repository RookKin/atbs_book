Logging Levels:
    DEBUG - logging.debug() - The lowest level. Used for small details. Usually you care about these messages
                                only when diagnosing a problem

    INFO - logging.info() - Used to record information on general events in your program or confirm that things
                            are working at their point in the program

    WARNING - logging.warning() - Used to indicate a potential problem that doesn't prevent the program from working
                                  but might do so in the future

    ERROR - logging.error() - Used to record an error that caused the program to fail to do something

    CRITICAL - logging.critical() - The highest level. Used to indicate a fatal error that has caused or is about to
                                    cause the program to stop running entirely
