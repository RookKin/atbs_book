Methods:
    re.IGNORECASE - ignores capitalization
    re.DOTALL - Make the '.' special character match any character at all, including a newline; without this flag,
                '.' will match anything except a newline.
    re.VERBOSE - This flag allows you to write regular expressions that look nicer and are more readable by
                 allowing you to visually separate logical sections of the pattern and add comments.
