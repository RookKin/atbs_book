-a dictionary is a collection of many values
-list indexes can only be integers (i.e. spam[0]) while dictionary indexes can have different data types
-indexes for dicts are called keys and it is associated with a specific value. The relationship is called a key-value pair

Dictionary Example:
    >>> myCat = {'size': 'fat', 'color': 'gray', 'disposition': 'loud'}
    >>> myCat['size']
    'fat'
    >>> 'My cat has ' + myCat['color'] + ' fur'
    'My cat has gray fur'


Dictionaries vs. Lists
-dictionary items are unordered, list items are ordered
-because dictionaries are not ordered they cannot be sliced like lists
-Though dictionaries are not ordered, the fact that you can have arbitrary
 values for the keys allows you to organize the data in powerful ways.
 See birthdays.py for examples


Three dictionary methods:
keys(), values(), items()


    >>> spam = {'color': 'red', 'age': 42}
    >>> for v in spam.values():
            print(v)
    red
    42

    >>> for k in spam.keys():
            print(k)
    color
    age

    >>> for i in spam.items
            print(i)
    ('color': 'red')
    ('age': 42)
